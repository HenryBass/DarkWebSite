# This is a dark web page running on a Raspberry Pi. 

Goals:

. Runs on anything, even a flip phone
. All self hosted
. All secure

This is a fun project, still working on it! Feel free to upload .txt files to the books section!
Hopefully we have most major constitutions in most languages.

If you want, join the .onion IRC chat! Link on the site.
